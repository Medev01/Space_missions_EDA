# Space Missions EDA

This project aims to analyze and explore a dataset containing information about space missions. 
By conducting exploratory data analysis, we seek to gain insights into the history and trends of space exploration.

## Objectives
- Explore the dataset and clean the data as needed.
- Visualize key statistics and trends in space missions.
- Answer questions related to space missions.
- Share interesting findings and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be found (https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=2&pageSize=5).
It contains information about space missions, including launch dates, missions' objectives, spacecraft details, and more.


## Dataset Description

All **space missions from 1957 to August 2022**, including details on the location,
date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, 
and status of the rocket used for the mission.

- Company : name of the company
- location : the exact location of the mission
- Rocket : name of the Rocke used for mission 
- statusRocket : status of rocket ( is it Retired or active )
- country : the country 
- Date : date of mission 
- MissionStatus : is it Success	or Failure or Partial Failure or Prelaunch Failure

## Insights

1. **Mission Success Rate**: The overall success rate of space missions has improved over the years, with a noticeable increase in the late 20th century.

2. **Most Common Objectives**: The most common objectives of space missions include Earth observation, satellite deployment, and planetary exploration.

3. **Popular Launch Vehicles**: The dataset reveals that certain launch vehicles are preferred for space missions.


## Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis provides valuable insights into the world of space missions.
By examining historical data, we can see how space exploration has evolved over time, 
the objectives that have been pursued, and the missions' success rates. These findings can be used to inform future space mission planning and research.
